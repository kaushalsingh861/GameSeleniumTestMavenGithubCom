# GameSeleniumTestMaven
Maven-Selenium-TestNg project for Testing of www.game.co.za

I have added Maven Runtime in the Git Repo, that means the project can be directly run with command line. Just OPen the Command line from the project directory, and run mvnw <command>
for this project run mvnw test and the testcases execution will start. The files for this runtime are : 
		.mvn/
        mvnw
        mvnw.cmd
